# CarbonFootprint Flight CO2 Emissions Tracker

CarbonFootprint is an app that helps users calculate their carbon footprint from air travel. With CarbonFootprint, you can:

* Input your trip details, including departure and arrival airports, to calculate your carbon emissions.
* See how many trees you would need to plant to offset your emissions.
* Add your trips to a trip portal so you can track your carbon footprint over time.
* Delete trips from your trip portal.
* View a single trip and click to plant a tree. This will take you to more information on how to do this.

CarbonFootprint is a simple and easy-to-use app that can help you understand the environmental impact of your air travel. By using CarbonFootprint, you can make more informed decisions about your travel and take steps to reduce your carbon footprint.
